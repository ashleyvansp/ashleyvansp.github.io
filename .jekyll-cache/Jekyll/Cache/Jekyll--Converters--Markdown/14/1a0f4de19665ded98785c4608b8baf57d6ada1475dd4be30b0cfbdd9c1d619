I"9<p>At the time of this writing, social distancing and isolation are the perhaps the most recommended ways to “stay safe in these unprecedented times”. It turns out that an isolated environment can keep your computer safe, too. Sandbox environments, virtual machines, and software containers can all help to protect your local machine from contamination or compatibility issues. Virtualization also increases flexbility, allowing you to run different OS-specific programs on the same hardware. And since the last year has proven that the only constant is change, virtual machines give the comfort of disaster recovery, making it easier to backup data or scale a platform. Regardless of the reason that your code isn’t running locally, it’s important that development feels seamless, with all the comforts of home.</p>

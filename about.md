Once upon a time, I was an acrobatic gymnast competing internationally as a trio for Team Canada. 10+ years in the sport instilled in me a strong work ethic, a love for teamwork, and a passion for travel. Long flights and extended layovers provided lots of free time, which I often filled by doing puzzles. This, along with some fantastic grade school math teachers, sparked my interest in all things problem-solving.

In August 2020, I completed the coursework for my undergraduate studies at the University of Victoria, where I majored in math and computer science. As an interdisciplinary student, I was fascinated with how tools from one domain can solve problems in the other. Through multiple co-op experiences in the tech industry, I became intrigued with the role of empathy in software development and how thoughtful communication drives effective teamwork. Going forward, I am eager to apply my skills in agile web development, machine learning, and data science to solve meaningful problems in industry.

Offline, I enjoy exploring the Rockies, playing cards, live music, and long bike rides.
